# D6-Jokers
A Balatro mod that adds a new kind of joker that has it's effect determined by a roll of the die. 

Welcome to D6 Jokers! This is a Balatro mod that adds 28 jokers, with a special twist. Instead of having a fixed effect, each D6 Jokers has six D6 sides. At the start of the blind, the die is rolled and that joker's effect will be determined by the D6 side rolled until the next blind is selected. Comes with 7 new consumables called "Dice Modifiers" that manipulate the D6 Sides.
