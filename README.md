# D6-Jokers
A Balatro mod that adds a new kind of joker that has it's effect determined by a roll of the die. 

Welcome to D6 Jokers! This is a Balatro mod that adds 29 jokers, with a special twist. Instead of having a fixed effect, each D6 Jokers has six D6 sides. At the start of the blind, the die is rolled and that joker's effect will be the D6 die until the next blind is selected. This also comes with 5 Tarot cards and 4 Spectral cards to let you upgrade the die, die faces, and further manipulate your D6 jokers.
